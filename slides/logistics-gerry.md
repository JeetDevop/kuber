## Exercises

- At the end of each day, there is a series of exercises

- To make the most out of the training, please try the exercises!

  (it will help to practice and memorize the content of the day)

- We'll try to finish a bit earlier each day so that you can have lab time

  (and if you can put some extra time that's even better â™¥)

- Each day will start with a quick review of the exercises of the previous day

- If you have any questions, blockers, curiosities ... Ping me in the zoom chat
