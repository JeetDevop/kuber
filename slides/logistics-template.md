## Exercises

- At the end of each day, there is a series of exercises

- To make the most out of the training, please try the exercises!

  (it will help to practice and memorize the content of the day)

- We recommend to take at least one hour to work on the exercises

  (if you understood the content of the day, it will be much faster)

- Each day will start with a quick review of the exercises of the previous day
